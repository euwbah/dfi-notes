# 2. Guidelines

#### Systematic approach
1. Initial assessment
	- Situation
	- Nature of case
	- Type of evidence
	- Known disk format
	- Location of evidence
2. Determine preliminary design or approach
	- How to acquire evidence
	- Plan chain of custody --- transport of evidence & in an **approved secure evidence container**
	- Preparing **forensics workstation**
3. Create a checklist
4. Determine required resources
5. Acquire evidence drives
6. Identify risks
7. Mitigate / minimize risks
8. Test design
9. Analyze & recover evidence
10. Investigate data
11. Complete the case report
	- What you did, what you found
	- Include generated report from the forensic analysis tools
	- Ensure **repeatable findings**
	- Show conclusive yes/no evidence
	- Have a journal of everything done
	- Who what when wheere why how
12. Critique case & get learning points
	- How to improve performance?
	- Feedback
	

### Securing evidence
- Evidence bags
- Antistatic bags/pads
- Well padded containers
- Evidence tape to seal CD drive bays, I/O cable slots
- Write initials
- Consider humidity, temperature

## Private-sector investigations
#### Employee termination
Mainly due to abuse of corporate assets

**Requires**
- Organization's Internet proxy server logs
- Suspect computer's IP address
- disk drive

**Additional Steps**
- Extract URLs
- Get proxy server log from network admin
- Compare data with proxy server log

#### Email abuse
**Requires**
- copy of offending e-mail with message header data
- e-mail server log
- access to e-mail server if e-mails are stored there
- access to suspect's computer

**Additional Steps**
- Obtain suspect's and victim's e-mail folder / data
- extract all related e-mail address information using forensic software's keyword search
- Examine header data

#### Attorney-client privilege
- A case of confidentiality
- All findings must be confidential
- Attorneys like print outs of recovered data, but they need to be educated that digital evidence can be viewed on a computer

**Additional Steps**
- Request memorandum from attorney directing to start the investigation
- Get a list of keywords & run keyword searches
- Use different tools for disk drive images
- Compare hash signatures between original and recreated disks
- Use tools to extract data from registry
- Obtain appropriate software for proprietary non-plaintext formats.
- For unallocated data, use a tool to remove non-printable chars
- Minimize written communications with attorney
- Writings to the attorney must contain a header stating _**"Privileged Legal Communication --- Confidential Work Product"**_

#### Industrial Espionage Investigations
- Should be treated as criminal investigations

**Requires**
- Computing investigator personnel to do disk forensics
- Tech specialist knowledgeable of the suspected compromised technical data
- Network specialist who can perform log analysis and set up network sniffers
- Threat assessment specialist (i.e. attorney)

**Additional Steps**
- Only initate investigation after approval from management
- Does it involve industrial espionage?
- Consult corporate attorneys & upper management
- Get keywords for disk forensics and sniffer
- Phone logs
- Surveillance at key locations
- Report regularly to mgmt. and corporate attorneys

## Interviews & Interrogations
**Interview**
:	conducted to collect info from witness / suspect

**Interrogation**
:	to get a suspect to confess

#### Role as an investigator:
- Instruct interrogator/interviewer (or yourself) on what questions to ask and what answers should be
- Be patient
- Repeat and rephrasing questions
- Be tenacious

## Setting up forensics workstation
- Windows XP or later
- write-blocker
- acquisition tool
- forensic analysis tool
- correct drive for evidence disks
- PATA/SATA ports
- USB ports

## Gathering Evidence
- Avoid damanging it
- Meet IT manager
- Fill evidence form, have IT manager sign
- Place in secure container & Secure
- Chain of custody form

#### Bit-stream copy vs Bit-stream image
A bit-stream copy will clone a disk as another disk, resulting in a exact functioning replica disk, but a bit-stream image will copy all the exact data, but into a file instead -- known as the *image file*

### **THE FIRST RULE OF FORENSICS**
** PRESERVE ORIGINAL EVIDENCE!!! **
-- only conduct analysis on a copy of the data.

## ProDiscover Basic
- Can acquire & analyse
- Has keywords

## ergo
- Must be systematic
- Specialised workstations
- Public-sector and private-sector differ esp. **search warrants**
- Chain of custody of evidence
- Internet related ---> proxy server log
- Attorney-client privilege --> written comm = confidential
- normal file backup vs. bit-stream copy vs. bit-stream image
- always keep a journal
- always critique your own work
