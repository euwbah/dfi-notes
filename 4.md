# 4. Data acquisition

Forensics acquisition tools will store data as an image file

### 3 image file formats
**1. Raw**
	e.g.: `.bin`, `.raw`, `.dd`, `.001`, `.img`
	Copies bit-stream data directly into files as in a bit-stream image file.
	Data transfers will be fast, no additional operations needed, just copy 1-to-1.
	But... requires as much storage as original disk/data
	Tools also may not collect bad sectors

**2. Proprietary**
	e.g.: `E01` (EnCase), `Ex01` (Expert Witness), `.eve`/`.cmp` (ProDiscover non-compressed / compressed)
	The Expert Witness format is the unofficial standard. (Expert Witness is the originating company of SMART and EnCase tools)
	Option to compress image files
	Can split images into smaller segmented files
	Can integrate metadata into image files
	But... proprietary formats will not have cross-tool compatibility

**3. Advanced Forensics Format**
	Uses the `.AFF` extension.
	`.AFD` extension for segmented images.
	`.AFM` extension for AFF metadata.
	Developed by Dr. Simson L. Garfinkel
	Is open-source.
	- Option to compress image files
	- No size restrictions for disk-to-image files
	- Provide space in image file or segmented files for metadata
	- Simple extensible design
	- Cross platform & OS

### Types of acquisitions:
- On-site || remote
- Static || live
- disk-to-image file
- disk-to-disk
- logical disk-to-disk / disk-to-data file
- sparse data copy

#### disk-to-image file
- Most common method
- Image files can be copied multiple times
- Copies are bit-for-bit replications (_i.e. bit-stream data_)
- Most forensics tools support this

#### disk-to-disk
- When disk-to-image copy is not possible
- EnCase, SafeBack, SnapCopy

#### Logical acquisition
- Captures only specific files of interest
- Can take a long time to find and selectively choose files

#### Sparse acquisition
- Collects fragments of unallocated (deleted) data

Both logical & sparse acquisition is used for very large disks that would make no sense acquiring a complete copy of the whole thing. (e.g.: PST or OST mail files, RAID servers)

### Determining the best acquisition method
- Duration the source disk can be kept in custody, or whether it can be retained at all
- The size of the source disk
	+ Lossless compression can be useful
	+ After acquisition using lossless compression, use digital signatures to verify that the uncompressed files are exactly the same as the originals
	+ Use tape backup if the drive is too huge and really everything is needed

### Contingency planning
- Make at least 2 images of digital evidence using different tools and techniques
- Copy **host protected area** of a disk drive
	+ Using a hardware acquisition tool that can access the drive at BIOS level
	+ This part of a disk drive will not be visible to the OS
- Be prepared to ask for passwords
	+ BitLocker **whole disk encryption** can make things difficult
	+ User must provide decryption key

Acquisition methods
-----------------

### via Software Acquisition (GUI acquisition tools)
- Advantages:
	+ Makes acquiring evidence more convenient
	+ hot-swapping benefits
- Disadvantages
	+ Must have a hardware write blocker
	+ Cannot copy the host protected area
	+ Some countries' courts don't accept acquisitions made through write-blocking devices

**Using ProDiscover Basic:**
Before acquiring:
- Document chain of custody of evidence
- Remove drive from suspect's computer
- Configure drive's jumpers to prevent write
- Connect to write blocker
- Create storage folder on target drive

**Using AccessData Forensics ToolKit Imager Lite**
- Makes disk-to-image copies
- both at logical partition & physical disk level
- Can segment the image file
- Same preparatory procedure as ProDiscover
	+ Need to use hardware write-blocker

### via LiveCD boot
- Advantages:
	+ No need to use a hardware write-blocker
	+ Boot directly on the suspect's computer -- no need portable workstation
- Disadvantages:
	+ Still cannot copy host protected area...

**Using Mini-WinFE:**
- Windows forensic boot CD/DVD/USB
- Choose a target drive to write acquired evidence to
- Other drives will be mounted as read-only
- Can run any program that runs on windows
- No need hardware write-blocker

### via Remote Acquisitions

> Copying data via a network connection

Can be inhibited by:
- Anti-virus
- Anti-spyware
- Firewalls


#### using ProDiscover Incident Response

**ProDiscover Incident Response** can remotely...
- Capture volatile system state information
- Analyze current running processes
- Locate hidden files & processes
- Remotely view & listen to IP ports
- Hash comparisons
- Create a hash inventory of all files

**PDServer** remote agent
- ProDiscover utility for remote access
- Needs to be loaded on the suspect's device via:
    + Trusted CD
    + Preinstallation
    + *"Pushing out"* (e.g. via Active Directory) and running remotely
- Can run in stealth mode & appear as OS function

Remote connection security features:
- Password protection
- Encryption
- Secure Communication Protocol
- Write Protected Trusted Binaries
- Digital Signatures

#### using EnCase Enterprise
can remotely...
- Acquire RAM & media
- Integrate with intrusion detection system tools
- optionally create an image of data from one or more systems
- preview systems

RAID support for both hardware & software

#### using R-Tools R-Studio
- Remote connection is encrypted via Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)
- Creates raw format acquisitions


Validating Data Acquisitions
----------------------------

Validations done via hashing
- CRC-32
- MD5
- SHA-1/256/384/512...

Windows doesn't have built-in hashing tools, need to use 3rd party

Commercial forensics software have bespoke built-in validation

Raw images don't contain metadata for validation -- requires separate manual validation.
