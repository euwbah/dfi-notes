# 4. Data acquisition

Forensics acquisition tools will store data as an image file

### 3 image file formats
**1. Raw**
	e.g.: `.bin`, `.raw`, `.dd`, `.001`, `.img`
	Copies bit-stream data directly into files as in a bit-stream image file.
	Data transfers will be fast, no additional operations needed, just copy 1-to-1.
	But... requires as much storage as original disk/data
	Tools also may not collect bad sectors

**2. Proprietary**
	e.g.: `E01`, `Ex01`
	The Expert Witness format is the unofficial standard. (Expert Witness is the originating company of SMART and EnCase tools)
	Option to compress image files
	Can split images into smaller segemented files
	Can integrate metadata into image files
	But... proprietary formats will not have cross-tool compatibility

**3. Advanced Forensics Format**
	Uses the `.AFF` extension.
	`.AFD` extension for segmented images.
	`.AFM` extension for AFF metadata.
	Developed by Dr. Simson L. Garfinkel
	Is open-source.
	- Option to compress image files
	- No size restrictions for disk-to-image files
	- Provide space in image file or segmented files for metadata
	- Simple extensible design
	- Cross platform & OS
