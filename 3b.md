# 3b. Current forensics tools

### 5 roles of digital forensics tools:

#### 1. Acquisition

Acquisition is making a copy of...
	+ Physical data &/
	+ Logical data

In a format that is..
	+ Raw data &/
	+ Vendor specific / proprietary

Via tools with a ... interface
	+ Command-line &/
	+ GUI

That can be done...
	+ Remotely / On-site
	+ Live (_i.e. while it is running_)
	+ Static (_i.e. while the system is powered off_)

**IMPORTANT RULE OF ACQ.:**
> **If it was off --- leave it off!**
> **If it was on --- leave it on!**

RAM acquisition also exists.

A raw bit-stream image file can be viewed with a hex editor and will show all bytes of data on the acquired disk / RAM from start to finish

#### 2. Validation & Vertification

Validation
:	A way to confirm that a tool is functioning as intended

Verification
: 	Verifies data by proving that two sets of data are identical (_i.e. comparing hash values_)
:	also includes verifying that the file header metadata corresponds with other info (_e.g. checking that the file signature in the header corresponds with the file extension in the file name -- a clear sign of suspicious activity_)

e.g. of hashes:
- CRC-32
- MD5
- SHA-1/256/512

Hash values can be used as search queries to easily find files that are 100% identical to a spec. file

#### 3. Extraction

- Extraction = data recovery
- The most difficult task to master
- 1st step of analyzing evidence

Functions include:
1. Data viewing
2. Keyword searching
3. Decompressing
4. Carving -- getting info from raw data without file metadata (possibly because it was corrupted / deleted)
5. Decrypting
	- password dictionary attack
	- brute-force attack
6. Bookmarking / tagging


#### 4. Reconstruction
- Recreating a suspected drive to show what happened dur. the incident
- via:
	+ disk <--> disk
	+ partition <--> partition
	+ image <--> disk
	+ image <--> partition
	+ rebuilding files from carving data runs

disk-to-image copy is the simplest method.

Can be done via:
- linux `dd` command
- ProDiscover
- Voom Technologies Shadow Drive

#### 5. Reporting
(Creating a report)

Includes:
- Bookmarks, tags
- Log reports
- Report generator

## Some software tools

### Command-line tools:
- Norton DiskEdit
	+ MS-DOS command line tool
	+ One of the pioneer tools for computer investigation


### GUI Tools

GUI tools are easier to use, can multitask, & no need to learn older OSs.
But... they use more resources, produce inconsistent results, and makes investigators very dependant on one tool/suite, since some GUI forensics tool software has plenty of features -- which is something that should be avoided.

#### Linux tools:
UNIX has mostly been replaced by Linux, but there's still some UNIX ones...

**SMART**

**Helix 3**
- Easiest suites to begin with
- Can load on a live Windows system
- From cold boot, it loads as a bootable linux OS
- **(Some international courts have not accepted live acquisitions as a valid forensics practice)**

**Kali Linux**

**Autopsy & Sleuth Kit**
- Autopsy is a GUI interface for SleuthKit

## Some hardware tools

### Forensics workstations

Can be **stationary**, **portable** or **lightweight**.

Some vendors offer specialised workstations for forensics:
- F.R.E.D. unit (Digital Intelligence)
- Hardware mounts from ForensicPC

Can be custom built to suit different cases

#### Recommendations
For stationary/lightweight workstations:
- Full tower for expansion devices
- don't scrimp on memory or processor
- different hard drive sizes
- 400-watt or better power supply with UPS
- drive adapters

If budget is limited, high-end game PCs will also work

### Write blocker

Can also be software, but hardware write blockers are better.

- FireWire
- USB 2 / 3
- SATA
- PATA
- SCSI

## Validating & Testing forensic software

Software must be tested and validated to prove that evidence recovered is accurate and can be admitted in court.

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** publishes articles, provides tools and creates procedures for testing/validating forensics software.

National Institute of Standards and Technology creates testing tools based on **ISO 17025** criteria for testing items that have no current standards, or standard testing methods if any.

The lab must:
- establish categories for digital forensics tools
- identify forensics category requirements
- develop test assertions
- identify test cases
- establish a test method
- report test results

**ISO 5725** --- results must be repeatable and reproducible.

**National Software Reference Library (NSRL)**
- Has the **Reference Data Set(RDS)**
	+ SHA-1 hashes of all known commercial software applications and OS files
	+ Can be used to search for info on specific software
	+ Can also use the Reference Data Set to locate and indentify known bad files

### Validation protocols
- Always verify results by using multiple tools to perform the same task
- Understand how the forensic tools work
- 
**Computer Forensics Examination Protocol**
- Perform investigation with a GUI tool
- Verify results with a disk editor
	+ Views raw HEX of the disk
- Compare hash values obtained between the tools

**Digital Forensics Tool Upgrade Protocol**
- Test all new updates / versions
- If there is a problem, report to vendor
- Don't test a new tool on the actual disk!
- Research the internet for new editions, updates, validation tests, reported bugs, announcements etc
